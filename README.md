#Welcome to the Nease Robotics Programming Team!
Ok so it's build season, and you all know what that means... Non stop code for several weeks! Woo Hoo!
So rev up those IDEs and get your ctrl+a ctrl+c ctrl+v game ready, because it's time to solve
problems we didn't know we had and time to identify problems only GOD can fix.
Have fun.
PLEASE FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE CONCEPT OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING, WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME TO CODE
