I'll be acting as the administrator for this repository, which means I see and determine the fate of every line of code submitted here, so impress me with the boundless knowledge you are bequethed with every Thursday from 4:00 to 5:15. Also, anyone who know's Morse code just blink questions to me, it's easier than talking.

PLEASE FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE CONCEPT OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING, WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME TO CODE
